Example B: Post-Grad Curriculum Syllabus
Time beyond graduation is broken into phases to provide a more clear and concise expectation of students on what they are responsible for and what they can expect from Career Coaches and Codeup resources until Day 1 of their new career. 
Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4)
Bi-weekly scrum / check in calls to get an update on:
What have they been working on since the last call? 
What are they working on today?
Do you have any roadblocks?
Provide relevant updates from the Codeup team.
Developers are encouraged to pick a skill / technology that they want to specialize in to create a more versatile resume for the job market. Example React, Angular, Vue, or Salesforce Admin certifications.
Developers are encouraged to find at least 1-2 new technologies and / or skills.
Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8)
Developers are encouraged to utilize their specialized skill / technology and complete a passion project that can be used on their resume.
This project can be completed as a solo project or a paired partner project. 
This needs to be a project that the developer WANTS to do.
After project completion an appointment will be set with a Codeup staff to update resume with recent technologies, projects, and achievements completed since graduation.
Bi-weekly scrum / check in calls to get an update on:
What have they been working on?
What are they working on currently?
Do they have any roadblocks?
Provide any relevant updates from the Codeup team.
At the end of week 8 developers will present projects to other post graduates through demonstration to show off their work.
Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12)
Developers are encouraged to either continue learning more advanced methods with specialized technology or pick a new skill / technology to learn.
Daily scrum / check in calls to get an update on:
What have they been working on?
What are they working on currently?
Do they have any roadblocks?
Provide any relevant information from the Codeup team.



Phase 4 (Weeks 13-16)
Developers are encouraged to utilize their specialized skill / technology and complete a passion project that can be used on their resume.
This project can be completed as a solo project or a paired partner project. 
This needs to be a project that the developer WANTS to do.
After project completion an appointment will be set with a Codeup staff to update resume with recent technologies, projects, and achievements completed since graduation.
Daily scrum / check in calls to get an update on:
What have they been working on?
What are they working on currently?
Do they have any roadblocks?
Provide any relevant updates from the Codeup team.
At the end of week 16 developers will present projects to other post graduates through demonstration to show off their work.
Phase 5 (Weeks 17-24)
Developers are encouraged to either continue learning more advanced methods with specialized technology or pick a new skill / technology to learn.
Daily scrum / check in calls to get an update on:
What have they been working on?
What are they working on currently?

Provide any relevant updates from the Codeup team.
Phase 6 (Weeks 25+)
All available resources will still be provided to the developer and will be encouraged to attend daily scrum meetings with those currently in Phase 5.
Every post graduate’s needs and availability will be different - There is room for flexibility and customization depending on their needs. At this point their efforts will be reciprocated from Codeup staff.
